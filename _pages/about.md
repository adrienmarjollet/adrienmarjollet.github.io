I recently obtained my P.h.D in the field path integral of molecular dynamics (theoretical/computational physics) in the CFEL-DESY Theory Group at DESY in Hamburg. During my PhD, I have developped and implemented a framework of simulation tools that allows for detailed, efficient and accurate simulations of gas-phase chemical reactions.

I am currently looking for new opportunities outside academia, more particularly in data analytics and machine learning.

I am also interested in Decentralized Finance (DeFi) as many interesting situations and exotic collective behavior can emerge from this wild space.

Aside from quantitative things, Iâ€™m interested in history, people and long-distance running.
