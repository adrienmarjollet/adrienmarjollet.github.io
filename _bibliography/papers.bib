abstract = {Abstract Understanding the influence of different forms of energy (eg, translational, vibrational, rotational) on chemical reactions is a key goal and great challenge in physical chemistry. Very recently, we proposed a new approach to obtain state-selective cross sections that approximately include quantum effects such as zero-point energy and tunneling. The method is a combination of the widely used quasiclassical trajectory approach (QCT) and the ring polymer molecular dynamics method and thus is numerically very efficient and easily employed. Here, we present a detailed description of the method and exhaustive tests of its accuracy and applicability. The robustness of the approach is tested, as well as the convergence with the number of beads. The approach is then applied to several prototypical X + H2(ν = 0, 1), X = Mu, H, D, F, Cl reactions over a wide range of collision energies. Good agreement with rigorous quantum dynamics simulations is found for most cases. Encouraging improvement over QCT results is found for particular cases, while only a small increase in numerical cost is required.},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
